# Major Projects Till 8th February 2019

This repository contains the major projects work that i have done till now (8th February 2019).

**Hardware + Machine Learning(ML) Project**

***Sign and Voice Recognizer (SVR):*** SVR is a part of a hackathon project me and my roommate, Mohit, build during our Internship at Microsoft, India. SVR (pronounced as स्वर, sʋəɾ) is a glove that is aimed at helping people with impaired hearing and people who have difficulty in speaking/ talking to others: It recognizes sign language gestures of the wearer and converts them to speech.

**Computer Vision Projects using Deep Learning Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**1. Object Detection - Car Detections - Algorithms used in Self-Driving Cars**

An autonomous vehicle needs sensory input devices like cameras, radar and lasers to allow the car to perceive the world around it, creating a digital map. However, this algorithm focused on the imaging where cars perform object detection using state-of-the-art YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithm. Here’s an example:

**2. License Plate Detection**

License Plate Recognition Systems use the concept of optical character recognition to read the characters on a vehicle license plate.

License Plate Recognition algorithm takes the image of a vehicle as the input and outputs the characters written on its license plate.

**Results**

Input - Image 1:

Result on Image 1 - after license plate detection

A red Bounding Box around license plate is created.

Leadership is interpersonal influence Exercised in a situation

and directed through the communication process towards

the attainment of a specific goal or goals. Merce deadership

is the process of influencing the members of the group

with respect to good setting and goal achievement.

for our purpose leadership may be dassified at 3 levels

Top Managers - The Big Boss

Middle Managers - Simply Boss

Front Live Managers - Foremon and Supervisor

All of them opcrate on different levels and have

ditterent vespers Lilhex and duties having the same problemi

of dealing with people and leading them.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A LEADER

. The leader is constantly interacting and commanding

a part of his
