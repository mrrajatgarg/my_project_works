# Major Projects Till 8th February 2019

This repository contains the major projects work that i have done till now (8th February 2019).

**Hardware + Machine Learning(ML) Project**

***Sign and Voice Recognizer (SVR):*** SVR is a part of a hackathon project me and my roommate, Mohit, build during our Internship at Microsoft, India. SVR (pronounced as स्वर, sʋəɾ) is a glove that is aimed at helping people with impaired hearing and people who have difficulty in speaking/ talking to others: It recognizes sign language gestures of the wearer and converts them to speech.

See the project short video here:

**Computer Vision Projects using Deep Learning Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**1. Object Detection - Car Detections - Algorithms used in Self-Driving Cars**

An autonomous vehicle needs sensory input devices like cameras, radar and lasers to allow the car to perceive the world around it, creating a digital map. However, this algorithm focused on the imaging where cars perform object detection using state-of-the-art YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithm. Here’s an example:

and directed through the communication process towards

the attainment of a specific goal or goals. Merce deadership

is the process of influencing the members of the group

with respect to good setting and goal achievement.

for our purpose leadership may be dassified at 3 levels

Top Managers - The Big Boss

Middle Managers - Simply Boss

Front Live Managers - Foremon and Supervisor

All of them opcrate on different levels and have

ditterent vespers Lilhex and duties having the same problemi

of dealing with people and leading them.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A LEADER

. The leader is constantly interacting and commanding

a part of his

. The leader makes the organization

self image

**3. Chatbots**

will upload a video of that work soon.

**4. Document Similarity**

Information Retrieval systems are used in many applications including Google Search. Document Similarity is about comparing two documents and determining how similar they are based on their semantic meaning. Applications like these are performing very good thanks to advancement of deep learning and natural language processing algorithm.

Following algorithms and research papers and studied and implemented :-
1. Word2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. Tf-idf

Results:

Input Documents:

documents = [ "Machine Learning and Deep Learning will change the world!",

         "Machine Learning and Deep Learning has the potential to change the world!",

         "Blockchain can change the world in future!"]
         
Similarity between documents:

SImilarity between Document 1 and Document 2: 72%

Similarity between Document 1 and Document 3: 18%
