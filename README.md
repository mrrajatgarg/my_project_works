This repository contains the major projects work that i have done till now (8th February 2019).

**Hardware + Machine Learning(ML) Project**

***Sign and Voice Recognizer (SVR):*** SVR is a part of a hackathon project me and my roommate, Mohit, build during our Internship at Microsoft, India. SVR (pronounced as स्वर, sʋəɾ) is a glove that is aimed at helping people with impaired hearing and people who have difficulty in speaking/ talking to others: It recognizes sign language gestures of the wearer and converts them to speech.
