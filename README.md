# Major Projects Till 8th February 2019

This repository contains the major projects work that i have done till now (8th February 2019).

**Hardware + Machine Learning(ML) Project**

***Sign and Voice Recognizer (SVR):*** SVR is a part of a hackathon project me and my roommate, Mohit, build during our Internship at Microsoft, India. SVR (pronounced as स्वर, sʋəɾ) is a glove that is aimed at helping people with impaired hearing and people who have difficulty in speaking/ talking to others: It recognizes sign language gestures of the wearer and converts them to speech.

**Computer Vision Projects using Deep Learning Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**1. Object Detection - Car Detections - Algorithms used in Self-Driving Cars**

An autonomous vehicle needs sensory input devices like cameras, radar and lasers to allow the car to perceive the world around it, creating a digital map. However, this algorithm focused on the imaging where cars perform object detection using state-of-the-art YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithm. Here’s an example:

**2. License Plate Detection**

License Plate Recognition Systems use the concept of optical character recognition to read the characters on a vehicle license plate.

License Plate Recognition algorithm takes the image of a vehicle as the input and outputs the characters written on its license plate.

**Results**

Input - Image 1:

Result on Image 1 - after license plate detection

A red Bounding Box around license plate is created.
